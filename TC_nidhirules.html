    <h1>Nidhi Rules</h1>    
    <pre>
Nidhi companies are governed by the Companies Act, 2013 more specifically Section  406 of the said
Act besides of course, the Nidhi Rules, 2014 and the amendments thereafter of the  rules in 2019,
2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024. An extract from Google is reproduced here below stating  the salient
features about the Nidhi companies. These companies are regulated by the Ministry of  Corporate
Affairs (MCA) and do not require a license from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to Commence  
operations. However they follow the directions of the RBI on financial matters, particularly the
deposit  taking and acceptance area. A Nidhi company shall not carry out the business of chit 
funds, higher  purchases, leasing, or insurance business.  <br>
These rules mandate that they function as public companies, deal only with members for  
lending/borrowing and maintain specific member/capital thresholds (like 200 members, ₹20 Lakhs
NOF), and are required to file forms like NDH-1, NDH-4, etc. with penalties for non-compliance.
The various Acts mentioned herein above are available as downloads for a more detailed  
understanding. Please finding here below an overview about the Nidhi category of companies.
